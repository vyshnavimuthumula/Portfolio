# Portfolio
This is my second project for udacity Full stack web developer.
### Technologies used:
 1)HTML
 2)CSS
 3)BOOTSTRAP
 #### HTML
  I used div,h1,h2,a and footer tags.
Here are just a few things you can do with CSS:
Choose colors of everything on the page like the background, font, or main menu.
Set the size of any element such as font size, width of the entire site, or an image
Create borders or drop shadows around whole sites, images, and menus
Change the state of items when hovering over them.
Be sure to validate your html.
Consult the specs below these instructions for advice on styling your CSS files.
### Instructions
Create a new repository in GitHub called Basic-Portfolio.
Clone this repository to your computer using the process we went over in class.
Navigate to the Portfolio folder that you just cloned onto your machine. Inside this folder, create the following:
HTML documents: portfolio.html.
A folder called assets.
Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: css and images.
In the css folder, make a file called portfolio.css.
Push the above changes to GitHub.
Make sure to git add . and git commit -m "initial site files". Then type git push origin master to push your changes to your GitHub repo.
